# BattleshipApp
This is my training .NET Framework Console project. It is a two player battleship console game. 

## Game logic
 In this two player game, possible ship locations are A through E for rows and 1 through 5 for columns.
 Ships are a size of one grid spot and each player has 5 ships.
 Game begins with each player placing their 5 ships on the grid.
 Players take turns trying to sink the other player's ships. The first player to sink all 5 ships wins.
 Shots are in the format of A1, B3, E4, etc.

 ## Improvements
 Possible improvement would be to ask the player what grid dimension he would like to play on.
